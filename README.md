# PA0_ReverseSocket
Internet Tech Project 0 

Partners: Isaac Brukhman and 
RUIDs: ivb8

Issues:
- only works on localhost bc the connection is continuously refused when we try to connect.

Collaborations:
- We collaborated with eachother when we could not get the server to work
- google is our best friend when it comes to socket work but we couldn't figure out why connection kept refusing 

Problems:
We had issues with getting the server to connect properly with any DNS ip that we gave. 
The example, "vi.cs.rutgers.edu" that was given kept giving a connection refusal and
we could only get the localhost to work

Lessons:
- The basics of how to work sockets interms of sending, recieving, connecting, and closing
- Revisting the basics of Python since it's been a while
- Look for office hours
